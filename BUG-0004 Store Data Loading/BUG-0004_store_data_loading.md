# STORE-0001: Store - Data Loading

[Summary]
The application lacks proper loading states when fetching store data from the map interface. It incorrectly displays "No Store" during data fetching, and when clicking between different store icons on the map, it continues showing the previous store's name until the new data loads. This creates confusion for users, especially those with slower internet connections, who may mistakenly believe there are no stores available at their location.

[Precondition]

- Software version: ViSiTa (HG.011.000)
- Software configuration: Default store settings
- Hardware specifications: Standard supported devices
- Network configuration: Various connection speeds (particularly noticeable on slower connections)

[Steps to reproduce]

1. Log into the ViSiTa application
2. Navigate to the main page with the map interface
3. Click on a store icon on the map to view store details
4. While data is loading, note the display shows "No Store"
5. Click on a different store icon on the map
6. Observe that the previous store's name remains displayed until the new data loads

[Actual results]

- During initial data loading after clicking a map icon, the application displays "No Store" instead of a loading indicator
- When clicking between different store icons on the map, the previous store's name remains visible until new data loads
- Users with slower internet connections may incorrectly assume no stores exist at the selected map location
- No visual indication that store data is currently being fetched from the server

[Expected results]

- A clear loading state (spinner, progress bar, or "Loading..." text) should be shown while store data is being fetched
- When clicking between store icons on the map, the UI should immediately indicate loading of new data
- Previous store data should be cleared or marked as "loading" when transitioning between map selections
- Adequate feedback for users on slower internet connections

[Additional information]
As shown in the included screen recording, the lack of proper loading states in the map interface creates a confusing user experience. When users click on store icons on the map, they need clear feedback that data is loading. Currently, users may make incorrect assumptions about store availability at their selected location, particularly those with slower network connections who experience longer loading times between clicking a map icon and seeing the store data.

[Is this Breakage?]
Yes, improper UI feedback during data loading

[Severity: How does this problem impact the customer/user?] 6. Severe GUI, usability, and accessibility issue

[Likelihood: How often will a customer/user use this feature/function?] 8. Very high, core functionality for store browsing

[Repeatability: Is this problem easily reproducible?] 10. 100% Reproducible (more noticeable on slower connections)

[Impacted Test Cases]
STORE-0001, UI-0023

[Impact Sizing (in days)]
1 day
