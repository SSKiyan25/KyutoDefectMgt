# SEARCH-0003: Search - Combined Search

[Summary]
The search functionality fails when attempting to search for a combination of store and product using formats like "<Store> + <Product>" or "<Product> + <Store>". Users cannot perform combined searches through the navigation bar search feature.

[Precondition]

- Software version: ViSiTa (HG.011.000)
- Software configuration: Default search settings
- Hardware specifications: Standard supported devices
- Network configuration: Standard internet connection

[Steps to reproduce]

1. Log into the ViSiTa application
2. Navigate to the top navigation bar
3. Click on the search bar
4. Enter a search query in the format "<Store> <+> <Product>" (e.g., "Sweet Prince BBQ")
   or "<Product> <+> <Store>" (e.g., "BBQ Sweet Prince")

[Actual results]

- The system fails to return relevant results for the combined search
- No error message is displayed
- The search either returns no results or incorrect results that don't match the combined criteria
- Users cannot efficiently find products at specific stores

[Expected results]

- The system should properly interpret the combined search
- Search results should display products that match both the store and product criteria
- Results should be relevant regardless of the order ("<Store> <+> <Product>" or "<Product> <+> <Store>")
- Clear feedback if no matches are found for the combined search

[Additional information]
The combined search functionality is critical for users trying to locate specific products at particular stores. The current implementation forces users to perform separate searches and manually filter results, significantly reducing usability.

[Is this Breakage?]
Yes, feature not working as designed

[Severity: How does this problem impact the customer/user?] 6. Severe GUI, usability, and accessibility issue

[Likelihood: How often will a customer/user use this feature/function?] 8. Very high, core functionality for many users

[Repeatability: Is this problem easily reproducible?] 10. 100% Reproducible

[Impacted Test Cases]
SEARCH-0003, UI-0003

[Impact Sizing (in days)]
1-2 days
