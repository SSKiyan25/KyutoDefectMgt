# SEARCH-0005: Search - Empty Results Handling

[Summary]
When a search query returns no results, the system fails to display a "No Results Found" message in the search bar. This leaves users uncertain whether the search was processed correctly or if there are truly no matching results.

[Precondition]

- Software version: ViSiTa (HG.011.000)
- Software configuration: Default search settings
- Hardware specifications: Standard supported devices
- Network configuration: Standard internet connection

[Steps to reproduce]

1. Log into the ViSiTa application
2. Navigate to the top navigation bar
3. Click on the search bar
4. Enter a search query that will certainly return no results (e.g., a random string of characters)
5. Press Enter or click the search icon
6. Observe the search results area

[Actual results]

- No "No Results Found" message is displayed in the search bar or results area
- The search results area appears empty without any feedback
- Users have no clear indication that the search was completed successfully with zero results
- Creates confusion about whether the search functionality is working properly

[Expected results]

- A clear "No Results Found" message should be displayed in the search results area
- Optionally, suggestions for alternative searches could be provided
- The system should indicate that the search was processed successfully but returned no matches
- A user-friendly empty state that guides users on what to do next

[Additional information]
The absence of proper empty state handling in the search functionality creates a poor user experience. The screenshots provided show the current behavior where no feedback is given when a search returns no results.

[Is this Breakage?]
Yes, missing UI feedback for empty search results

[Severity: How does this problem impact the customer/user?] 5. Moderate usability issue affecting user experience

[Likelihood: How often will a customer/user use this feature/function?] 7. High, search is a core functionality

[Repeatability: Is this problem easily reproducible?] 10. 100% Reproducible

[Impacted Test Cases]
SEARCH-0004, UI-0003

[Impact Sizing (in days)]
Less than a day
