# PROD-0001: Add Product Functionality Not Handling Store State and Duplicates

[Summary]
The "Add Product" functionality allows users to add products even when the Store state is "No Store", which should be prevented. Additionally, the system does not warn users or prevent duplicate product entries, potentially leading to data inconsistency issues.

[Precondition]

- Software version: ViSiTa (HG.011.000)
- Software configuration: Default product management settings
- Hardware specifications: Standard supported devices
- Network configuration: Standard internet connection

[Steps to reproduce]

1. Log into the ViSiTa application
2. Navigate to the Product Management section
3. Observe that the current Store state is set to "No Store"
4. Click on "Add Product" button
5. Fill out product details and submit
6. Observe that the product is successfully added despite "No Store" state
7. Repeat steps 4-5 with identical product information
8. Observe that duplicate product is created without any warning

[Actual results]

- Products can be added when Store state is "No Store"
- Duplicate products can be created without any warning or validation
- No validation errors are displayed during either scenario
- System allows potentially inconsistent data to be stored

[Expected results]

- The system should prevent adding products when Store state is "No Store"
- A clear error message should be displayed explaining why the action cannot be completed
- The system should detect duplicate product entries during submission
- A warning should be displayed when attempting to create a duplicate product
- If duplicates are not intended to be allowed, form submission should be blocked

[Additional information]
This issue creates potential data integrity problems and confusing user experiences. Products associated with "No Store" have unclear ownership and may cause reporting or inventory management issues. Duplicate products can lead to inventory tracking problems and customer confusion.

[Is this Breakage?]
Yes, data validation issue

[Severity: How does this problem impact the customer/user?] 7. High, potential for data inconsistency

[Likelihood: How often will a customer/user use this feature/function?] 8. Very high, product addition is a core functionality

[Repeatability: Is this problem easily reproducible?] 10. 100% Reproducible

[Impacted Test Cases]
PROD-0001, VALIDATION-0003, STORE-0002

[Impact Sizing (in days)]
1-2 days
