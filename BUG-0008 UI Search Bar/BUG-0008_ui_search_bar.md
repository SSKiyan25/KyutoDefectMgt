# UI-0003: Search Bar UI Missing Critical Functionality

[Summary]
The search bar UI component lacks necessary interface elements to support both combined search functionality and proper empty results handling. The current implementation does not provide clear visual cues or controls for combined searches, nor does it display appropriate feedback when searches return no results.

[Precondition]

- Software version: ViSiTa (HG.011.000)
- Software configuration: Default search settings
- Hardware specifications: Standard supported devices
- Network configuration: Standard internet connection

[Steps to reproduce]

1. Log into the ViSiTa application
2. Navigate to the top navigation bar
3. Observe the search bar UI component
4. Notice the absence of:
   a. Visual indicators or controls for combined search functionality
   b. Proper empty state handling interface
5. Attempt to perform a combined search using "<Store> + <Product>" format
6. Enter a search query that returns no results

[Actual results]

- The search bar UI lacks visual indicators for combined search capability
- No help text or tooltips exist to guide users on how to perform combined searches
- No interface elements are present to handle empty search results
- When no results are found, the UI fails to display any feedback message
- Users have no clear guidance on how to use advanced search features

[Expected results]

- The search bar UI should include clear visual indicators for combined search functionality
- Help text, tooltips, or example placeholder text should guide users on search syntax
- An appropriate empty state UI component should be present
- When no results are found, a clear "No Results Found" message should display
- The UI should offer suggestions for alternative searches when appropriate
- Interface should provide clear feedback on search status and results

[Additional information]
This UI design issue compounds the existing functional problems with combined search (BUG-0002) and empty results handling (BUG-0003). The absence of proper UI elements makes these features unintuitive for users and reduces discoverability. A redesigned search component is needed that clearly communicates search capabilities and provides appropriate feedback in all scenarios.

[Is this Breakage?]
Yes, significant UI design issue affecting core search functionality

[Severity: How does this problem impact the customer/user?] 7. High, impacts usability of a core feature

[Likelihood: How often will a customer/user use this feature/function?] 9. Very high, search is a primary interaction point

[Repeatability: Is this problem easily reproducible?] 10. 100% Reproducible

[Impacted Test Cases]
SEARCH-0003, SEARCH-0004, UI-0003, UI-0006

[Impact Sizing (in days)]
2-3 days
