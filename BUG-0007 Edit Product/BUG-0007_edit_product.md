# PROD-0002: Product Edit Functionality Lacks Duplicate Value Validation

[Summary]
The "Edit Product" functionality allows users to modify product details without validating for duplicate values. When editing a product, the system does not warn users or prevent the creation of duplicate product entries, potentially leading to data inconsistency issues.

[Precondition]

- Software version: ViSiTa (HG.011.000)
- Software configuration: Default product management settings
- Hardware specifications: Standard supported devices
- Network configuration: Standard internet connection

[Steps to reproduce]

1. Log into the ViSiTa application
2. Navigate to the Product Management section
3. Select an existing product and click "Edit Product"
4. Modify the product details to match another existing product's key identifiers
5. Submit the changes
6. Observe that the product is successfully updated without any duplicate validation
7. Navigate to the product listing and observe that there are now two products with identical key information

[Actual results]

- Product can be edited to have values identical to another existing product
- No duplicate detection or validation is performed during the edit process
- No warning messages are displayed when creating a duplicate entry
- System allows potentially inconsistent data and duplicate entries to exist

[Expected results]

- The system should detect when an edit would result in a duplicate product entry
- A warning should be displayed when attempting to save changes that would create a duplicate
- Users should be required to confirm if they intentionally want to create a duplicate
- If duplicates are not intended to be allowed, form submission should be blocked with an appropriate error message
- The system should maintain data integrity by enforcing unique product identifiers

[Additional information]
The screenshots provided show the edit product interface and the resulting duplicate entries in the product listing. This issue compromises data integrity and can lead to significant confusion in inventory tracking, ordering, and customer-facing product displays.

[Is this Breakage?]
Yes, data validation issue

[Severity: How does this problem impact the customer/user?] 7. High, potential for data inconsistency

[Likelihood: How often will a customer/user use this feature/function?] 7. High, product editing is frequently used

[Repeatability: Is this problem easily reproducible?] 10. 100% Reproducible

[Impacted Test Cases]
PROD-0002, VALIDATION-0003, DATA-INTEGRITY-0001

[Impact Sizing (in days)]
